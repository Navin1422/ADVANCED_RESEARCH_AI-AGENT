# Advanced Research Agent (ARA)

The **Advanced Research Agent (ARA)** is a cutting-edge, autonomous system designed to execute complex, multi-step research inquiries, synthesize information from diverse sources, and generate high-quality, structured reports. Leveraging a modular architecture powered by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized tools, ARA transforms raw queries into actionable, expertly curated knowledge.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Autonomous Multi-Step Planning:** Automatically decomposes a high-level research goal into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
* **Dynamic Information Retrieval:** Utilizes adaptive searching strategies across various data sources (web, specialized databases, local files) for comprehensive data collection.
* **Source Verification & Fact-Checking:** Incorporates mechanisms to cross-reference and verify information, minimizing hallucination and improving factual accuracy.
* **Modular Processing Pipeline:** Features dedicated modules for data ingestion, analysis, synthesis, and final report generation.
* **Structured Report Generation:** Delivers final output in customizable formats (e.g., Markdown, PDF, JSON), including citations and a clear summary of findings.
* **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with external APIs and specialized tools (e.g., code execution, statistical analysis) to enrich research capabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The ARA operates on a layered, modular framework:

1.  **Planner Module:** Interprets the user query and generates a **Research Plan** (a sequence of actions, required tools, and intermediate goals).
2.  **Executor Module:** Manages the execution of the plan, invoking the necessary specialized agents and tools.
3.  **Tool Agents:** Specialized sub-agents (e.g., `SearchAgent`, `DatabaseAgent`, `CodeExecutionAgent`) that handle specific tasks.
4.  **Synthesizer Module:** Aggregates and refines the gathered information, focusing on consistency and relevance.
5.  **Reporter Module:** Formats the final research report according to the specified output configuration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* API Key for the chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
* *Optional:* Access credentials for specialized data sources (e.g., arXiv, JSTOR, internal databases).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-research-agent.git](https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-research-agent.git)
    cd advanced-research-agent
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Set Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and populate it with your API keys:

    ```ini
    # .env file content
    LLM_API_KEY="your_llm_provider_api_key"
    LLM_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4-turbo"
    SEARCH_API_KEY="your_search_engine_api_key"
    OUTPUT_DIR="reports"
    ```

2.  **Customize Settings:**
    The core research parameters (prompts, tool configurations, timeout limits) are managed in `config/settings.yaml`.

## üíª Usage

The agent can be run from the command line by providing a research query.

### Basic Run

```bash
python main.py --query "The impact of quantum machine learning on pharmaceutical drug discovery, focusing on algorithms developed post-2022."
